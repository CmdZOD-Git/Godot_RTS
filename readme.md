# This game was made with the Zenva tutorial

## Important things i learned with the Zenva tutorial
1. Calling the world2D to get what's under my mouse
2. Setting up a navigation agent
3. Get global time
4. Use modulate and await + in-line timer
5. Make a selection visual with a simple selection sprite
6. Basic event listener for mouse press

## From this base i expanded the game to train myself

2. Expend selection with a a target indicator
3. Healthbar
4. Area selection with mouse
5. Camera Move and Zoom in/out
6. Health regen & associated particles
7. Hit impact
8. Basic UI for selected unit
9. Transform Unit & Action selection
10. Added Y-sort logic to Main
