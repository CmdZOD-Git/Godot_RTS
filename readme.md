# Important things i learned with the Zenva tutorial
This game was made with the Zenva tutorial

1. Calling the world2D to get what's under my mouse
2. Setting up a navigation agent
3. Get global time
4. Use modulate and await + in-line timer
5. Make a selection visual with a simple selection sprite

# What i want to do next

## SPRINT 1
1. DONE Switch from navigation region to tileset based navigation (PS : you can use both together !)
2. DONE Expend selection with a a target indicator
3. Healtbar
4. area selection with mouse as a first step to multiple unit game

# If i were to start from 0
